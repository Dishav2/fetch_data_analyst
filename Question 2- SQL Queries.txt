Question #2: SQL Queries

1. What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for most recent month?
SELECT TOP (5) BR.name, RE.dateScanned FROM rewardsReceiptItemList RL
INNER JOIN RECEIPTS RE ON RL.Receipts_ID = RE._id
INNER JOIN BRAND ON RL.barcode = BR.barcode
WHERE MONTH(dateScanned) = MONTH(now())    ###do I need this statement?
ORDER BY quantityPurchased

2. How does the ranking of the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the recent month compare to the ranking for the previous month? (To run these queries simultaneously in MSSQL for comparison)
SELECT TOP (5) BR.name, RE.dateScanned FROM rewardsReceiptItemList RL
INNER JOIN RECEIPTS RE ON RL.Receipts_ID = RE._id
INNER JOIN BRAND ON RL.barcode = BR.barcode
WHERE MONTH(dateScanned) = MONTH(now())
ORDER BY quantityPurchased


SELECT TOP (5) BR.name, RE.dateScanned FROM rewardsReceiptItemList RL
INNER JOIN RECEIPTS RE ON RL.Receipts_ID = RE._id
INNER JOIN BRAND ON RL.barcode = BR.barcode
WHERE MONTH(dateScanned) = MONTH(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP))
ORDER BY quantityPurchased


3. When considering average spend from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?
SELECT AVG(totalSpent) FROM RECEIPTS
WHERE rewardsReceiptStatus = "ACCEPTED" OR rewardsReceiptStatus = "REJECTED"
GROUP BY rewardsReceiptStatus

4. When considering total number of items purchased from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?
SELECT quantityPurchased FROM RECEIPTS
INNER JOIN rewardsReceiptItemList RL ON RL.Receipts_ID = RE._id
WHERE rewardsReceiptStatus = "ACCEPTED" OR rewardsReceiptStatus = "REJECTED"
GROUP BY quantityPurchased


5. Which brand has the most spend among users who were created within the past 6 months?
SELECT BR.name, MAX(totalSpent) FROM BRAND BR
INNER JOIN
(SELECT * FROM RECEIPTS RE
INNER JOIN rewardsReceiptItemList RL ON RL.Receipts_ID = RE._id
INNER JOIN USERS U on RE.userId = U._id
WHERE U.createdDate IN (March2023, August2023)
) t
ON BR.barcode = RL.barcode



6. Which brand has the most transactions among users who were created within the past 6 months?
SELECT BR.name, MAX(pointsEarned) FROM BRAND BR
INNER JOIN
(SELECT * FROM RECEIPTS RE
INNER JOIN rewardsReceiptItemList RL ON RL.Receipts_ID = RE._id
INNER JOIN USERS U on RE.userId = U._id
WHERE U.createdDate IN (March2023, August2023)
) t
ON BR.barcode = RL.barcode
